# stack.java

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates **stack operations** such as:

- Pushing elements onto a stack  
- Popping elements from a stack  
- Peeking at the top element  
- Checking if the stack is empty  
- Validating balanced parentheses (if applicable)  

## How It Works
The program uses Javaâ€™s `Stack` class (from `java.util`) to perform operations in a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** manner.  
It can be useful for problems like expression evaluation, undo operations, and checking for balanced parentheses.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arhaan133/stack.java.git
